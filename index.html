				<section> <!-- why change my system? -->
					<h2>Why change my system?</h2>
					<p>To focus more time on student learning.</p>
					<p>Lowers the student's focus on "What's my mark?"</p>
					<p>Students focus more on improving</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- Markless vs mark less -->
					<h2>Markless vs mark less?</h2>
					<p>Personal goal would be to go markless - this would help students focus on learning</p>
					<p>In the mean time, I do a lot less <strong>marking</strong> for my students</p>
					<p>I do give a <strong>lot</strong> more feedback though</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- title -->
					<h2>Theory - Overarching Learning Goals (OLGs)</h2>
					<p>Evaluate on 3-5 items</p>
					<p>Assess based on learning goals and success criteria</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- evaluations (show graphics for ICS courses) -->
					<h2>Evaluate</h2>
						ICS2O - 3 goals
						ICS3U - 3 goals
						ICS4U - 3 goals
					<p>All the goals are based on the overall expectations</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- assessments -->
					<h2>Assessments</h2>
					<p>All assessments are broken down into learning goals and success criteria (as per Growing Success)</p>
					<p>3 rubrics for the whole course (based on OLGs)</p>
					<p>Rubric subsections are based on learning goals</p>
					<p>Success Criteria are listed in the rubric</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- assessments continued (projects, tests, etc.) -->
					<h2>What assessments do I do?</h2>
					<p>Almost 0 tests (ICS2O @ 0, ICS3U @ 1, ICS4U @ 2)</p>
					<p>Do mainly large and small projects, a couple group projects, and presentations</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- evidence -->
					<h2>What do I provide to the students?</h2>
					<p>Feedback via Single-point rubrics</p>
					<p>No marks - focus is on learning</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- how do we mark less? -->
					<h2>How do we mark less?</h2>
					<p>Focus the students on the learning process</p>
					<p>Give out larger projects rather than a lot of little ones</p>
					<p>Allows for more feedback</p>
					<p>Sit with students when giving feedback, and update their rubric on the spot</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- what does this look like -->
					<h2>What does my class look like?</h2>
					<p>Give large projects that last at least a week</p>
					<p>Spend most of my time walking around helping students individually</p>
					<p><strong>Minimal</strong> stand and deliver (10-20 minutes a week on average)</p>
					<p>Allows me a lot of time to give individual feedback</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- how do I start this? -->
					<h2>How do I start this?</h2>
					<p>Focus on the important points of the course</p>
					<p>Turn the classroom into a learning-focused class (rather than mark driven)</p>
					<p>Continuously focus the student's attention to learning (rather than marks)</p>
					<p>Free up a lot of "marking" time by providing feedback and updating rubrics <strong>in-class</strong></p>
